			<h1>Hobby.</h1>

		<p> As far any hobbies go, I don’t have much anymore. I play a lot of games to cope with stress, but I always wanted to make my own Pokemon game. As of now, I bought a program that runs on the language Ruby, and downloaded a graphics pack to make the game. I’ve only done one map because I’ve been busy, and I haven’t coded in actions and interactions yet. It also looks like garbage (like me). There is a youtuber who made a series on how to make a Pokemon game, and goes in depth on how to do so using the program called RPG Maker XP. It’s $24.99, but is occasionally on sale for $4.99. I didn’t get it on sale since I wanted to start asap with my new classes coming soon. It’s slightly sad I won’t be learning the specific language at OTC, but the tutorials should be enough, with all 56 of them. Overall, I like the potential and can’t wait to get started on all the good bits of making the game. (See my trash map below.)</p>

		<h2>My Summer</h2>
		<p> I didn't do much this summer either than work 40 hours a week, every week and sleep. I got the occasional spare time to work on my side projects or draw, but nothing else really. </p>
		<p> Here's an example of what I became: </p>
